            <h4>March 14th - 7 PM</h4>
            <p class="home-first-p">
              Get ready for the most epic wave-riding experience to hit the
              landlocked paradise of Rexburg, Idaho ‚Äì it's the Beach Surfing
              Extravaganza! On March 14th, at 7 PM, don your wildest Hawaiian
              shirts, grab your surfboards (or boogie boards, we're not picky),
              and join us for an unforgettable evening of "surfing" like you've
              never seen before. Sure, there might not be an ocean nearby, but
              who needs it when you have the majestic Idaho landscape as your
              sandy backdrop? We've got inflatable palm trees, a kiddie pool for
              those daring enough to try a belly flop, and a tropical playlist
              that would make even a parrot do the hula. Beware of the rogue
              tumbleweeds ‚Äì they're our version of ocean currents. So, wax up
              your sense of humor, ride those imaginary waves, and let's make
              some landlocked memories that will leave you saying, "Who needs
              the beach when you've got Rexburg's sandy spirit?" See you at the
              Beach Surfing shindig ‚Äì where the only thing deeper than the waves
              is our commitment to making waves of laughter! üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§ô
